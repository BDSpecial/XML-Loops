# XML-Loops
Many hospitals upload their quality data to a database called the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI). In order to help improve the efficiency and accuracy of the data being uploaded, I created a way to upload the data in a XML file. I was performing this process for 9 separate hospitals and uploading 10-15 separate quality metrics for 100's of hospital units each quarter. These jupyter notebook files show the python that I used for inserting the various metrics and units into their correct XML files.
